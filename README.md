# osu!oracle (WIP)

osu!oracle is a machine learning model aimed at categorizing osu! beatmaps into existing categories (aim, streams, speed, tech, etc). The end goal is to allow easy categorization of beatmaps without having to go into the editor or play them manually.

To test the model, open the directory in a terminal and run
```sh
python test_model.py <beatmap_id>
```
## Requirements
```
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
```
## Getting Started

1. Have a computer

## To-Do
> [ ] idk 


## Disclaimer 

This project is still a **massive WIP**. The model is in a functioning state but still needs tweaking along with a host of other issues. This is my first time working with both Python and ML so I'm sure there are better ways to do things.
